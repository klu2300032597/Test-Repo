Task 02 : Stopwatch Web Application This task involves developing an interactive and user-friendly stopwatch web application. The application should include the following key features:

Start, Pause, and Reset Functionality: Users should be able to start, pause, and reset the stopwatch seamlessly.

Lap Time Tracking: The application should allow users to record multiple lap times and display them in a structured format.

The goal is to create a responsive and visually appealing stopwatch that enhances the user experience while ensuring precise time tracking.


Acknowledgement

I would like to acknowledge the successful completion of the "Stopwatch Web Application" as part of SCT_WD_2 Task 02. This project was carried out independently, allowing me to explore and apply key web development skills including JavaScript functionality, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.

Developing features such as start, pause, reset, and lap time tracking helped me understand the importance of accuracy and user experience in web applications. The task also strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my interest in front-end development.

I am grateful for the availability of online documentation and community forums that provided valuable insights during the development process.
